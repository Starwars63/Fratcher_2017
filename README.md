# Fratcher_2017

Overview: 
This is the repository for the Webengineering Project for summer semester 2017 at the University of Kassel. 

The Project:
Frontend & Backend 
I'll start with the Backend: I have here these features  ...
1- Sign in 
2- Register 
3- View all users - in two cases either if the user hasn't sign in yet or 
when he's already in, he'll be able to view all the other users except his name so he won't be able to like/dislike
his posts.
4- The ability to accept a request.
5- The ability to view all users who already are matchable.
6- The ability to accept or ignore the request and in case the user was accepted.. it'll appear in the Matching list 
7- If he was ignored I won't be able to to see him in the "Request List" or "My Matches".
8- After the user has already accepted all the recieved requests he'll be able to view all users (who's online - who's not) and 
he can directly start chatting with other users who are online and it'll appear a table of 
all the history chats.
9-The user can sign into his his personal account, write/edit/delete the text/post that he want to share with other users.

Accourding to the Frontend:
